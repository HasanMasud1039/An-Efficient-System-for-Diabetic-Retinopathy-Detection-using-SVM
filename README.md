Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease caused by diabetes. Damage to the blood vessels
of the light-sensitive tissue in the rear of the eye causes this condition (retina). Diabetic
retinopathy may cause no symptoms or just minor vision abnormalities at first. However, it
has the potential to cause blindness. Anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes can develop the
illness. The longer you have diabetes and the less well your blood sugar is regulated, the
more probable you are to acquire this vision problem.
The objective of this project is to develop a method using Support Vector Machine(SVM)
for detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy from digital colour fundus images of
the retina.
